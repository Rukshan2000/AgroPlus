Drop the store logo image file here and name it exactly `logo.png` so the receipt will show it at the top.

Recommended: a PNG with transparent background, width ~ 300–600px. The receipt component expects the image at `/assets/logo.png`.

If you prefer a different name, update the `src` in `components/pos/ThermalReceipt.jsx` accordingly.
